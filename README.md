# Quotes App

# 8/4/2020

# Project Description
This is a web app for  Quotes Manager. It's comprised of a  display dection that shows all the quotes saved on the system, alongside a form to add more quotes to the system. The layout is friendly to use and basic/self-explanatory to a new user.

# Behaviour Driven Development
We utilise multiple components that work together to give us the final view we have. We have components for:
    The form
    Handling quotes
    Displaying extra details for each quote
    The header
    The footer
They are all nested in the final index.html that is the major renderer for all components we have and also some components are nested in each other like the one for handling quotes that has the one for extra details nested in it.
## Header section
On opening the site, the user gets a header section at the top of the page with the title of the app.

## Quotes Display Section
Next is the left section that has the quotes display that shows all the quotes added to the app.

## Add Quotes Section
This is the section on the right that has a form that allows the user to add new quotes to the app.
